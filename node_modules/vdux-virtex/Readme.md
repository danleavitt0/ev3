Stateless virtual dom &lt;-&gt; Redux

## Installation

    $ npm install vdux

### Running the examples

    $ cd examples/basic && budo --live index.js -- -t babelify

## Setup

vdux takes a stateless [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom), and wires it to a [redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) store.  You call it like this:

```javascript
vdux(store, app, rootNode)
```

From then on, when your `store` emits a state update, your new state atom will be passed to `app`, which will render into `rootNode`.

### Params

  * `store` - A redux store, or something that exports a similar interface (`subscribe`/`dispatch` functions).
  * `app` - A pure function that takes a single argument, state, and returns a virtual-dom tree.
  * `rootNode` - The DOM node in which to render `app`.

## DOM Events / Actions

Your DOM event handlers get setup in the standard way that [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) does it via delegation.  That is, you set an attribute on your element prefixed by `ev-` (e.g. `ev-click`).  Your event handlers are pure functions that return a value.  That value is then dispatched into redux.  This forms a [cycle](https://github.com/cyclejs/cycle-core) that will define your entire application in a side-effect free way.

```javascript
function counter (props) {
  return h('div', {'ev-click': increment}, ['Value: ' + props.counter])
}

function increment () {
  return {
    type: 'INCREMENT'
  }
}
```

## Side-effects

Almost side-effect free, anyway.  You still need to do things like issue requests.  I recommend you contain these effects in your redux middleware stack.  Here are some libraries / strategies for doing this:

  * [redux-effects](https://github.com/redux-effects/redux-effects)
  * [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk)
  * [redux-promise](https://github.com/acdlite/redux-promise)

## Ecosystem

  * [virtual-component](https://github.com/ashaffer/virtual-component) - Write virtual-dom with a deku/react like api, with hooks, shouldUpdate, and other civilized things.
  * [vdom-element](https://github.com/ashaffer/vdom-element) - Thin wrapper around virtual-component and `virtual-dom/h` that gives you a more standard JSX experience.
  * [vdux-local](https://github.com/ashaffer/vdux-local) - Give yourself some pseudo-local state, all in your single redux state atom.
